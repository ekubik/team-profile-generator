## Description
The project allows the user to quickly generate a profile of their work team. The user is asked to input employee details (names, employee ids, email addresses, github profiles etc.). These vary on the type of employee that is selected. Available employee types include manager, engineer and intern. Each team must have one manager, but the composition of the rest of the team is completely under the control of the user. The information input is then converted into a formatted HTML page, which can be found in the /dist folder.

## Technologies:
* Inquirer module
* Jest
* Node js
* Bootstrap CSS Framework

## Future Improvements
The project could be improved by placing some restrictions on input types - such as preventing the user from entering a null input.
